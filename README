This is a simple PHP script that creates .M3U playlists on the fly for
a selected folder. It makes the directory structure easily browsable
from a mobile device using the IUI JavaScript/CSS library.

To install, just place the index.php and .data folder at the top of the
directory you want to make browsable.
